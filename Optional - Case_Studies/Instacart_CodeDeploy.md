# Instacart’s Journey with AWS CodeCommit: A Case Study

### Introduction
---
As a leading online grocery delivery service, Instacart operates in a fast-paced environment where development agility and reliable deployment are critical. To keep up with these demands, Instacart partnered with AWS to harness the power of cloud-based development and DevOps tools, especially focusing on **AWS CodeCommit** as their primary version control solution. This decision became a keystone in their broader transition towards a continuous integration and deployment pipeline on AWS.

### The Challenge
---
As Instacart expanded, so did its codebase and developer team. Scaling their version control system to support more developers and repositories became essential. The need for a more robust, scalable, and secure solution led Instacart to AWS CodeCommit. With AWS, they sought to streamline version control, improve collaboration, and reduce the operational overhead that came with managing traditional repositories.

### Why AWS CodeCommit?
---
AWS CodeCommit offered Instacart a managed, highly scalable version control system compatible with Git, eliminating the need to manage their own Git infrastructure. CodeCommit integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeBuild**, supporting Instacart’s goal of building a CI/CD pipeline to deliver code updates more frequently and reliably.

### Solution Implementation
---
Instacart combined **AWS CodeCommit** with AWS’s suite of DevOps tools for an efficient CI/CD setup. Here’s how each component contributed to their solution:
1. **AWS CodePipeline**: Allowed Instacart to automate their build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that every change was consistently delivered across environments.
2. **AWS CodeBuild**: Helped manage their build process, providing a fully managed build service that scales with demand and integrates well with CodePipeline.
3. **AWS CodeDeploy**: Enabled smooth, automated deployments across their EC2 instances, allowing Instacart’s developers to focus on building features without needing to worry about deployment reliability.

### Key Outcomes
---
Instacart realized several benefits by adopting AWS CodeCommit and its complementary services:
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: CodeCommit's scalability allowed for more repositories and collaboration, enabling developers to work together without the bottlenecks associated with a self-managed Git solution.
- **Accelerated Deployments**: Through CodePipeline and CodeDeploy, Instacart significantly reduced the time required for testing and deploying code, moving closer to a continuous delivery model.
- **Improved Security and Compliance**: AWS’s security features, such as encryption and permissions controls, ensured that code access was secure and aligned with compliance standards.

### Conclusion
---
AWS CodeCommit and the broader AWS DevOps toolkit provided Instacart with the infrastructure and tools needed to scale their operations. By automating their CI/CD pipeline and centralizing their code repositories, Instacart can now focus on delivering new features faster and enhancing the shopping experience for its customers.
