# Instacart’s Migration from PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB

In 2020, **Instacart**, a leading online grocery platform, undertook a substantial migration from PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service from AWS. This transition was driven by the need for scalable and reliable performance at lower operational costs. Here’s an overview of Instacart’s journey, challenges, and key outcomes from their migration experience.


### Motivation for Migration
---
Instacart initially managed its backend data through a PostgreSQL database. However, as the platform grew, PostgreSQL's limitations in managing high-throughput workloads at low latency became apparent. The primary motivations for moving to DynamoDB included:

1. **Scalability**: DynamoDB’s horizontal scaling and partitioning features addressed the need to manage increasing data loads, especially in times of peak demand.
2. **Performance Consistency**: With automatic partitioning, DynamoDB could ensure consistent response times, even under high load.
3. **Cost Optimization**: By reducing the complexities and high costs associated with maintaining a sharded PostgreSQL system, Instacart aimed to minimize operational overhead.


### Migration Strategy
---
Instacart adopted a phased approach, allowing a smooth transition from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB with minimal service disruption. Key aspects of their migration strategy included:

- **Dual Writing**: To ensure data consistency, Instacart began by writing data to both PostgreSQL and DynamoDB tables.
- **Phased Read Shifts**: After validating data consistency, the team gradually shifted read operations to DynamoDB, enabling a seamless migration for various teams.
- **Data Model Optimization**: Instacart restructured its data using DynamoDB’s single-table design approach, which reduces reliance on join operations by embedding related data within single items, ultimately minimizing costs and improving query performance.


### Challenges and Solutions
---
Migrating to DynamoDB presented unique challenges, especially around data modeling and cost management:

1. **Denormalization Requirements**: Unlike relational databases, DynamoDB does not support complex joins. To handle this, Instacart adopted a denormalized, single-table design that encapsulated related data within single records, thus improving query efficiency.
2. **Index Management**: To reduce costs associated with Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs), Instacart modified its primary key design to eliminate the need for these costly GSIs.
3. **Capacity Optimization**: By understanding DynamoDB's pricing model based on storage and throughput, Instacart implemented the necessary design optimizations to avoid expensive read and write operations.


### Outcomes and Key Takeaways
---
Post-migration, Instacart reported significant benefits in terms of scalability and performance. The migration has allowed various teams, including marketing and subscription management, to rely on DynamoDB's scalable structure to manage millions of records effectively. Other key outcomes included:

- **Reduced Operational Costs**: DynamoDB’s managed service model eliminated the need for complex, high-cost database sharding, leading to operational savings.
- **Improved Performance**: DynamoDB's inherent low-latency response and scalability across distributed workloads supported Instacart’s peak usage times.
- **Increased Reliability**: With DynamoDB's multi-region and Availability Zone replication, Instacart improved its data durability and resilience, crucial for a platform with high availability demands.


Instacart’s migration experience highlights the effectiveness of DynamoDB for large-scale, high-throughput applications and showcases how thoughtful data modeling and phased migrations can yield operational and cost benefits.
